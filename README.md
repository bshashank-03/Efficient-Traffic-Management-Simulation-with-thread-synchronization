# Efficient-Traffic-Management-Simulation-with-thread-synchronization
<p>I modelled a typical traffic scenario in this project, where a flag person is guiding traffic and one lane is closed. There is construction going on on one side of the road, thus all east and westbound traffic must synchronise to go through the area without causing a traffic block or accident.</p>
